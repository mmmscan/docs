# MMM Token (MMM)

The MMM token is the native currency of the MMM blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## MMM utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the MMM blockchain, MMM is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake MMM to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.mmmscan.com/](https://status.mmmscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MMM. Which means validators with higher amounts of MMM staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any MMM holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of MMM they wish. They receive a share of the MMM block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As MMM is the native currency on MMM, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, MMM transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of MMM tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the MMM platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
