# The MMM Blockchain

## Network Overview and Key Metrics

MMM is the decentralized EVM-compatible public blockchain that powers the MMM platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of MMM.

The MMM blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) for achieving [consensus](https://docs.mmmscan.com/general/fuse-network-blockchain/fuse-consensus). The consensus is secured by a significant number of independent validators, only one of which is run by the MMM core team.

Validators are also responsible for the most important type of governance on MMM, namely, adopting the network protocol changes via [MMM Improvement Proposals](https://docs.mmmscan.com/general/fips) (FIPs). 

The native token of the network is called MMM. New MMM tokens are issued with every added block and are also use to pay for gas, just like ETH on Ethereum. 

The MMM blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on MMM is around 5 seconds, and it currently costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

In its present capacity, the MMM blockchain is capable of processing around 120 native token transfers and 60 TL20 token transfers per second. The faster processing of native token transfers is due to the fact that they do not involve computations run on the network's virtual machine.
